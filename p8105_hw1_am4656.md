# Problem 1

The penguins dataset includes location, time, and anatomic features of
individual penguins. Notable features of the tabulated data include the
following:

-   Important variable names include: species, island, bill_length_mm,
    bill_depth_mm, flipper_length_mm, body_mass_g, sex, year.
-   The number of rows is 344.
-   The number of columns is 8.
-   The mean flipper length, in millimeters, if we ignore missing values
    is 200.9152047.

# Problem 2

The data frame below is comprised of a random sample of size 10 from a
standard normal distribution, a logical vector indicating whether
elements of the sample are greater than 0, a character vector of length
10, and a factor vector of length 10 with 3 different factor “levels”.

    ## # A tibble: 10 × 4
    ##    norm_samp vec_logical vec_character vec_factor
    ##        <dbl> <lgl>       <chr>         <fct>     
    ##  1   -0.841  FALSE       ""            1         
    ##  2    1.38   TRUE        ""            2         
    ##  3   -1.26   FALSE       ""            3         
    ##  4    0.0701 TRUE        ""            1         
    ##  5    1.71   TRUE        ""            2         
    ##  6   -0.603  FALSE       ""            3         
    ##  7   -0.472  FALSE       ""            1         
    ##  8   -0.635  FALSE       ""            2         
    ##  9   -0.286  FALSE       ""            3         
    ## 10    0.138  TRUE        ""            3

-   The mean of the norm_samp variable is -0.0788515.
-   The mean of the vec_logical variable is 0.4.
-   The mean of the vec_character variable is NA.
-   The mean of the vec_factor variable is NA.

The mean is able to be calculated from the norm_samp values and from the
logical vector. Taking the mean of the character and factor variables
does not work.

However, the code chunk below can be used to coerce non-numeric
variables to be treated as an integer (e.g. to convert categorical level
to a numeric value) and could then be used to calculate the mean of the
factor variable. This will not affect the already-calculated mean of the
norm_samp and logical variables.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, norm_samp)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_logical)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_character)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(prob2_df, vec_factor)))
```
